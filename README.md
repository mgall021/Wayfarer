This is an exciting new endeavor where our client aims to create a travel community platform for users to share their travel tips and experiences from all around the world. Whether you're a seasoned globetrotter or a first-time traveler, Project Wayfarer is designed to be a space where you can discover hidden gems, and share your own travel stories.

## Introduction
Project Wayfarer, our code-named travel community, is a web-based platform dedicated to travelers and adventurers. With an emphasis on user-generated content, we provide an opportunity for travelers to:

Share tips, recommendations, and insights about their favorite destinations.
Discover new places to explore based on fellow travelers' experiences.

This README document serves as a guide to help you understand the project, get started with development, and contribute to making Project Wayfarer a reality.

## Features
Project Wayfarer is designed to offer the following key features:

Search and Filter: Easily find posts by location, category, or keywords.

Responsive Design: Enjoy a seamless experience on desktop and mobile devices.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
